# clicky-game

ABOUT:

The Clicky Game is a memory game created with React, where users must select each image once within a deck of images. The theme of this game is from the show, Once Upon A Time from ABC. Each character within the show has a dopleganger, where the same actors and actresses play one character from our world and another from the Disney fairytale realm; making this game a little trickier to play.

HOW TO USE:

Once the deployed link has been opened, the show's theme song will immediately start to play and will loop until the user presses the pause button.

As users click through the images, they will shuffle each time clicked, and once the user accidentally clicks on the same image twice, a modal will pop up showing the users score and high score, and will let them play again once they hit okay.

The score and high score will be saved onto the jumbotron. Users can also refresh the game by clicking on the 'Reset Scores' button in the navigation bar.

The highest score users can reach is 12.
